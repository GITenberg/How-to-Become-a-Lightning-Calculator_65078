<p>Accuracy should be first considered, then
rapidity. Quick adders, by the way, are the
most accurate. Write the numbers in vertical
lines, avoiding irregularity. This is important.
Keep your thought on results not numbers
themselves. Do not reckon 7 and 4 are 11 and
8 are 19, but say 7, 11, 19 and so on.</p>

<p>When the same number is repeated several
times, multiply instead of adding.</p>

<p>When adding horizontally begin at the left.</p>

<p>In adding long columns, prove the work, by
adding each column separately in the opposite
direction, before adding the
next column. Many accountants
put down both figures as
in the illustration. The sum
of the first column is 12; carrying
<em>one</em>, the sum of the second
is 20; carrying <em>two</em>, the sum
of the third column is 15;
carrying <em>one</em>, the sum of the
fourth column is 21, and the
total, 21502, is found by calling
off the last two figures and the right-hand
figures, following the wave line in the
illustration. This method is better than the
old one of penciling down the number <em>to carry</em>.
If one desires to go back and add a certain
column a second time, the number to carry is
at hand and the former total is known.</p>

<p>To the inexperienced it will be a difficult task
to add two columns at once, but many of those
who have daily practice in addition find it
about as easy to add two columns as
one. Say 99 and 50 are 149, and 6 are
155, and 10 and 50 are 215 and 3 are
218, and 12 are 230. Carry 2, and say
33 and 12 are 45, and 20 are 65, and 6
are 71, and 30 are 101, and 2 are 103,
and 23 are 126.</p>

valuable little volume, entitled
“How to become expert with figures.” You

<h3>To Multiply Any Number by 11.</h3>

<p>Write the first right-hand figure, add the first
and second, the second and third, and so on;
then write the left-hand figure. Carry when
necessary.</p>

<p class="center">219434 × 11 = 2413774</p>

<p>Put down the right-hand figure 4. Then say,
4 and 3 are 7; then, 3 and 4 are 7; then, 4 and
9 are 13, put down 3 and carry 1; then, 9 and
1 and 1 are 11, put down the 1 and carry 1;<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
then, 1 and 2 and 1 are 4; then write the left-hand
figure 2. In multiplying small numbers,
such as 24 by 11, write the sum of the two
figures between the two figures, making 264,
the required product.</p>


<h3>To Multiply by 101, 1001, etc.</h3>

<p>To multiply by 101, add two ciphers to the
multiplicand, and add to this the multiplicand.</p>

<p class="center">2341 × 101 = 234100 + 2341</p>

<p>To multiply by 1001, add three ciphers to the
multiplicand, and add to this the multiplicand.</p>


<h3>To Multiply by 5, 25, 125.</h3>

<p>To multiply by 5, add a cipher and divide
by 2.</p>

<p>To multiply by 25, add two ciphers and
divide by 4.</p>

<p>To multiply by 125, add three ciphers and
divide by 8.</p>


<h3>Another Easy Way to Multiply.</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Columns">

<p>To multiply two figures by two figures, proceed
as follows: Multiply units by units
for the <em>first</em> figure.</p>

<p>Carry and multiply tens by units and
units by tens, (adding) for the <em>second</em>
figure. Carry and multiply tens by tens
for the <em>remaining</em> figure or figures. In
this example proceed as follows:</p>

<p style="padding-left:1em; line-height:1.25">2 × 4 = 8 = 1st figure.<br />
(4 × 8) + (5 × 2) = 42. Therefore 2 = 2d figure.<span class="pagenum">[5]</span><br />
(5 × 8) + 4 carried = 44 = 3d and 4th figures.</p>

<p>By a little practice any one may become as
familiar with this rule and as ready in its
application as with the ordinary method.</p>

<p>To multiply any number by <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>, add one
cipher, and divide by 4.</p>

<p>To multiply any number by <span class="nowrap">3 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span></span>, add one
cipher, and divide by 3.</p>

<p>To multiply by <span class="nowrap">33 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">3</span></span>, add two ciphers, and
divide by 3.</p>

<p>To multiply any number by <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">7</span></span>, add one
cipher, and divide by 7.</p>

<p>To multiply by <span class="nowrap">16 <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">3</span></span>, add two ciphers, and
divide by 6.</p>

<p>To multiply by <span class="nowrap">14 <span class="fnum">2</span>/<span class="fden">7</span></span>, add two ciphers, and
divide by 7.</p>

<p>To multiply by 875, add three ciphers, and
divide by 8.</p>

<p>To divide by 25, multiply by 4, and cut off
two figures.</p>

<p>To divide by 125, multiply by 8, and cut off
three figures.</p>

<p>To multiply by <span class="nowrap">12 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>, add two ciphers, and
divide by 8.</p>

<p>To find the value of any number of articles
at 75 cents each, deduct one-quarter of the
number from itself and call the remainder
dollars.</p>


<h3>To Subtract Any Number Consisting of
Two Figures from 100.</h3>

<p>Take the first figure from 9, and the second
from 10. For example: in subtracting 73 from<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
100, or in taking 73 cents change out of a
dollar, say 7 from 9 and 2, and 3 from 10 and
7, or 27 cents. Practice this rule. It is simple,
and will be found particularly helpful in making
change.</p>


<h3>Divisions.</h3>

<p>A number is divisible by 2 when the last
digit is even.</p>

<p>A number is divisible by 4 when the last two
digits are divisible by 4.</p>

<p>To divide by <span class="nowrap">12 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>, multiply by 8, and cut
off two figures.</p>


<h3>Simple Discount Rule.</h3>

<p>This simple rule is in use in many houses
where several discounts are allowed from list
prices. Suppose the list price of a piano to be
$500, and you allow an agent 25, 20 and 10 off.</p>

<div class="center">

<td class="tabspace">×</td><td class="tabright">90</td><td class="tabspace">=</td><td class="tableft">.540000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Subtract each from 100 and multiply and you
get .54. $500 × .54 = $270, the agent’s price.</p>

<h3>Percentage.</h3>

<p>The name percentage is applied to
certain arithmetical exercises in
which 100 is used as the basis of computation.
Per cent. is an abbreviation
of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per centum</i>, meaning
<em>by the hundred</em>. This sign % is
used for the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per cent.</i> Thus,
10% of a number equals <span class="fnum">10</span>/<span class="fden">100</span>, or <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">10</span> of
the number; 50% equals <span class="fnum">50</span>/<span class="fden">100</span>, or <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span>, etc.</p>

<p>Interest is the sum charged for the use of
money. It is really the <em>use of money</em> or the
benefit derived from its use. The principal is
the sum for the use of which interest is paid.
The rate of interest is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per cent.</i> of the principal
charged for its use for <em>one year</em>. Simple
interest is the interest on the principal only, for
the full time; compound interest is interest on
the principal for the full time, and interest on
each interest payment after it becomes due.</p>

<p>To find the accurate interest on any sum of
money at a given rate for one year, multiply
the sum by the rate and divide by 100.</p>

<p>To find the accurate interest on any sum of
money at a given rate for any given number of
days, multiply the interest for one year by the

<p>There are experts who can add very rapidly.
The best of them, however, cannot add up a
column of <em>ones</em> any faster than you can. Here
is how some of the rapid addition is
performed. The operator writes a
line of figures, then another, and
so on. The second line, however,
added to the first makes <em>nines</em>,
except at the extreme right, where
the two figures add to <em>ten</em>. The
third and fourth bear the same
relation, and as many more as he
chooses to put down. The last two
lines, however, are put down at
random. Now, to add these columns, he begins
anywhere, perhaps at the left-hand side, putting
down 2 (the number of <em>pairs</em> above), then by
simply adding the two bottom lines, he gets the
correct sum.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Bank_Discount">Bank Discount.</h2>
</div>


<p>The sum charged by a bank for cashing a
note or time draft is called bank discount.
This <em>discount</em> is the simple interest, paid in
advance, for the number of days the note has<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
to run. Wholesale business houses usually sell
goods on time and take notes from the retailers
in payment. These notes are not often for a
longer period than three months. Some are
placed in the banks for <em>collection</em>, others are
discounted. When a note is discounted at a
bank the <em>payee</em> endorses it, making it payable
to the bank. Both maker and payee are then
responsible to the bank for its payment. If
the note is drawing interest the discount is
reckoned on and deducted from the amount
due at maturity. Most notes discounted at
banks do not draw interest. The time in bank
discount is always the number of days from
the <em>date of discounting</em> to the <em>date of maturity</em>.</p>

<p>Example. A note of $250, dated July 7th,
payable in 60 days, is discounted July 7th, at
6 per cent.; find the proceeds.</p>

<p>This note is due in 63 days, or September
8th. The accurate interest of $250 for 63 days
at 6 per cent. is $2.59. The proceeds, then,
will be $250 - $2.59, or $247.41.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="How_to_Make_Change">How to Make Change.</h2>
</div>


<p>Salesmen usually make change by addition.
They have the money to count out, and in
doing so they add to the amount of the purchase
until they reach the amount of the bill
presented. For example, if you buy something
worth $3.35 and present a ten-dollar bill in
payment, you will probably receive in return 5<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, $1, and $5; the salesman
saying 40, 50, $4, $5; $10. This method
is least liable to error.</p>

<p>Accuracy and rapidity in counting out change
can best be acquired by practice behind the
counter or at the cash-desk.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Foregoing Table.</h3>

<p>The transposition of figures is a frequent
cause of errors in proving accounts and balance
sheets. This table is founded on the fact that
all differences between transposed numbers are
multiples of nine. The difference between the
figures misplaced is equal to the quotient of the
resulting error when divided by nine; thus, 91
- 19 = 72; 72 ÷ 9 = 8; 9 - 1 = 8, and the labor
of searching for it may be confined to examining
those figures the transposition of which
would make the difference, as they are the
only ones that can cause the error. Thus: if
the error in the balance-sheet be 81 cents, it is
possibly caused by a transposition, and the
clerk can first examine the cents column of his
books for items of 90 cents, or 09 cents, alone,
with a strong probability of finding the cause
of the error without further revision. Transpositions
may occur in any decimal or integer
place, and the differences caused thereby are<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
divisible by nine without a remainder; but,
beyond this table, the numbers ascend in regular
progression, each difference increasing by
nine, as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Columns">
<tr><td class="tabright" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">108</td>
<td class="tabbrace tabspace9" rowspan="2">{</td><td class="tabright">120</td>
<td class="tabright" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">;<span style="padding-left:0.3em">117</span></td>
<td class="tabbrace tabspace9" rowspan="2">{</td><td class="tabright">130</td>
<td class="tabright" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">;<span style="padding-left:0.3em">126</span></td>
<td class="tabbrace tabspace9" rowspan="2">{</td><td class="tabright">140</td>
<td class="tabright" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">;<span style="padding-left:0.3em">etc.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tabright">12</td><td class="tabright">13</td><td class="tabright">14</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The quotient of the difference in a regular
progression, when divided by nine, gives the
figures transposed, thus: 130 - 13 = 117 ÷ 9 = 13,
which are the figures to be sought for when a
discrepancy of 117 is shown; but this will not
apply to differences below 81, nor to mixed
transpositions. An error divisible by two may
be caused by posting an item to the wrong side
of the ledger.</p>

<p>Reduce the time to months, and to the
number thus found annex one-third of the
days, which whole number multiplied by one-half
of your principal will produce you the
required interest in dollars, cents and mills, at
6 per cent. If days only are given, multiply
one-third of the days by one-half of the principal
for the required interest at 6 per cent.

divide this product
by the quotient obtained
by dividing
360 (the number of
days in the interest
year) by the per
cent. of interest,
and the quotient
thus obtained will
be the required interest.
Require the
interest of $462.50 for one month and eighteen
days at 6 per cent. An interest month is 30
days; one month and 18 days equals 48 days.
$462.50 multiplied by .48 gives $222.0000; 360
divided by 6 (the per cent. of interest) gives 60,
and $222.0000 divided by 60 will give you the
exact interest, which is $3.70. If the rate of
interest in the above example were 12 per cent.,
we would divide the $222.0000 by 30 (because
360 divided by 12 gives 30); if 4 per cent.,
we would divide by 90; if 8 per cent., by 45;

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
